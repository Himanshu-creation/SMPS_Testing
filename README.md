## Voltage Divider Design

To scale ~40V to 3.3V for ADC input:
R1 = 39kÎ©, R2 = 3.3kÎ©
Vout = Vin Ã— (R2 / (R1 + R2))

## Web Interface

The entire system is controlled through a **web interface hosted on the ESP32-S3**. Once powered and connected to Wi-Fi, the ESP32 serves a webpage accessible via its local IP address.

Features of the Web Interface:

- Toggle each of the 8 SMPS relays manually  
- View real-time **voltage output** of each SMPS  
- Configure **ON time** and **OFF delay** for auto toggle cycle  
- Start/Stop **automated cycling** of each SMPS  
- Display **ON/OFF cycle count** for every relay  
- Live display of **temperature readings** from the MAX31856 thermocouple  

Simply connect to the same Wi-Fi network as your ESP32, and access the IP address shown in the Serial Monitor after boot-up.
